#Not About Me

Hello! My name is **totally not Aljoe Bacus**, and welcome to a project that is definitely not mine!

Well, let's add a twist to make this participative: comment in some words that do not describe me! Don't worry - I'm good at 'commitment', so I'll have no problem committing your descriptions as they appear from time to time.

This project has introduced you to an `alternate-reality` that any one of us can get to through the magic of *Git*. ;)

Thank you for diving in!
